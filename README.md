Jats
======

A dead simple task list manager where tasks can be assigned to people.

Installation
---------------

This application assumes a modern python development environment that
includes:

Python 3.5, virtualenv, pip, etc. Installing python 3 now means getting
the others by default but it is the onus of the user to create a virtual
environment tied to python 3.

The other main environmental dependency is Node.js version 6.x.

Database: Postgres 9.5

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

2. Install Python dependencies (inside your activated virtualenv):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Install Node.js dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
